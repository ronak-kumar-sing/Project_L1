## 🚀 Turning Knowledge into Creation! 🌐

I’m thrilled to share a project where I’ve applied everything I’ve been learning at Sheryians Coding School. This webpage is built with a foundation in HTML and CSS, showcasing not only the skills I’ve gained but also my passion for web design.

Each element and style choice represents a step in my learning journey—from structuring layouts to adding the finer visual touches. Seeing it all come together is both motivating and rewarding!
